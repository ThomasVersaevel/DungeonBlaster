	- Holds items picked up so far
	- Holds xp bar progress
	- On level up allow to upgrade a picked up item
	- needs a menu

refactor all sendMessage invocations

Level up ideas:

When level up you can choose
- stats
	- DMG
	- Speed
	- Regen
- items
	- Weapons to upgrade
- Combinations?

stat upgrades in the form of non-weapons like hats backpack boots etc.

Idea: Start with knife and upgrade with each pickup (per elements maybe?)

Zoom out over time to allow easier exploring and more play area.
